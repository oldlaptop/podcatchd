This is a basic commandline podcatcher. The long-range ominous plan is to make 
a real honest-to-goodness daemon out of it, capable of handling multiple 
podcasts, logging to actual syslog, and other fun things. For now there is a 
basic event loop which can sit in a tmux window and download podcasts as they 
come. POSIX sh, uses rsstail and requires a small rsstail patch from my rsstail 
fork. Intended to be superior to other GUI-less podcatchers in its surpassing 
simplicity.
